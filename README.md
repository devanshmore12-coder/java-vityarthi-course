This project implements a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a University Management System using core Java concepts, demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP), multithreading, collections, file I/O, and custom exception handling across three integrated modules.
Module	Core Features	Java Concepts Demonstrated
1. Student Management	Registration, Viewing, Updating, Searching.	OOP (Inheritance/Polymorphism), Custom Exceptions, Collections (ArrayList).
2. Course & Enrollment	Concurrent Enrollment Check, Capacity Management.	Multithreading with Synchronization (synchronized), Collections (HashMap).
3. Examination & Grade	GPA Calculation, Transcript Generation.	I/O Streams (BufferedWriter) for reporting, Collections (TreeMap) for sorting, Enums (GradeLetter).
4.
